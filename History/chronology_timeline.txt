Human history begins in Prehistory, stretching back millions of years. Around 2.5 million years ago, early humans started using stone tools, and by about 200,000 years ago, Homo sapiens appeared in Africa. Over time, they migrated across the world. Around 10,000 BCE, the Agricultural Revolution began in places like Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China, when humans shifted from hunting and gathering to farming and settled life. This was the foundation of civilization.

With the invention of writing around 3000 BCE, Ancient History began. In Mesopotamia, cuneiform was developed, while Egyptians used hieroglyphs, and writing systems also appeared in the Indus Valley and China. Great empires rose and fell: the Akkadians, Babylonians, and Persians in the Middle East; the Pharaohs in Egypt; the Maurya and Gupta Empires in India; the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties in China; and the Greek and Roman civilizations in Europe. Around this time, religions and philosophies like Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism, and later Christianity shaped societies. Trade routes such as the Silk Road connected distant lands by 200 BCE, spreading goods and ideas.

The Medieval Period began after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In Europe, feudal kingdoms took shape, and the Catholic Church dominated. Meanwhile, the Islamic Golden Age flourished from the 8th to the 13th centuries, with advances in science, medicine, and literature. In Asia, the Tang and Song dynasties expanded Chinese culture and innovation, while Japan developed its samurai and shogunate system. In Africa, kingdoms like Ghana and Mali grew powerful, with rulers such as Mansa Musa in the 14th century. The Mongol Empire, created by Genghis Khan in the early 13th century, became the largest land empire in history, linking Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. By the late Middle Ages, the Black Death (1347–1351) devastated Europe but also brought major social change.

The Early Modern Era started in the 15th century. The Renaissance revived learning and art in Europe, while the Protestant Reformation in 1517 challenged the Catholic Church. The Age of Exploration began in 1492, when Columbus reached the Americas, and soon European powers colonized vast regions of the world. At the same time, the Ottoman, Mughal, and Ming Empires thrived. The Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries transformed knowledge, with thinkers like Galileo and Newton reshaping how people understood nature.

The Modern Era unfolded from the late 18th century. The American Revolution in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789 introduced new ideas of liberty, equality, and democracy. Inspired by them, independence movements spread through Latin America in the early 19th century. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution, beginning around 1760 in Britain, changed economies and societies with machines, factories, and railroads. The 19th century also saw nationalism and imperialism, as European powers colonized much of Africa and Asia.

The 20th century brought both progress and tragedy. World War I (1914–1918) shattered empires and redrew borders. The Russian Revolution of 1917 created the world’s first communist state. World War II (1939–1945) brought destruction on an even greater scale, ending with the Holocaust, the atomic bomb, and the emergence of the United States and Soviet Union as global superpowers. The postwar world was marked by the Cold War (1947–1991), as capitalist and communist blocs competed for influence. At the same time, decolonization gave birth to new nations in Asia and Africa, and civil rights movements reshaped societies.

Finally, the Contemporary Era began in the late 20th century. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War, while rapid advances in technology created the digital age. The rise of globalization connected economies, cultures, and politics more than ever before. Today, the world faces both opportunities — in science, medicine, and communication — and challenges such as climate change, inequality, and global conflicts.
