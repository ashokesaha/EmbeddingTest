Samosa is one of the most iconic savory snacks of the Indian subcontinent, known for its crisp, flaky pastry and spicy filling. Preparing it is like building layers of flavor and texture, and though it seems simple, each step has its own importance. Let me take you through the process in detail, step by step, as if we were making it together in a kitchen.

The first step begins with the dough, which forms the outer shell of the samosa. For this, all-purpose flour is taken in a large bowl, and to it, a generous pinch of salt and ajwain or carom seeds are added. The seeds are not just for flavor, they also aid digestion, balancing the richness of fried food. Into this mixture, ghee or oil is rubbed in using fingertips. This rubbing is crucial, because it coats the flour particles with fat, and that is what later creates the flaky layers in the crust. The flour should resemble coarse breadcrumbs, and when pressed between fingers, it should hold its shape lightly. Only then is water added, little by little, to knead into a stiff dough, firmer than what you would make for rotis. The dough is covered with a cloth and allowed to rest for half an hour, which helps it relax and makes it easier to roll out later.

While the dough rests, attention turns to the filling, which is the heart of a samosa. The most traditional and loved version is the spiced potato and pea filling. Potatoes are boiled until tender, peeled, and roughly mashed so that there are still some small chunks left for texture. In a pan, a little oil or ghee is heated, and cumin seeds are added until they splutter. Into this, finely chopped ginger, green chilies, and sometimes a pinch of hing or asafoetida are sautéed. Then the dry spices follow—coriander powder, garam masala, amchur (dried mango powder), turmeric, and red chili powder. Each spice adds a layer, from warmth to tanginess, ensuring that the filling is not flat but multidimensional. Finally, the mashed potatoes are stirred in with boiled green peas, and everything is mixed until the flavors are absorbed. Fresh coriander leaves are sprinkled at the end, brightening up the filling. This mixture is cooled completely before being stuffed into the dough, otherwise steam would soften the pastry.

Now comes the shaping, which is what gives samosas their signature triangular look. The dough is divided into equal portions and rolled into small balls. Each ball is flattened into a circle, then cut in half to form two semicircles. One semicircle is taken, and its straight edge is joined with a little water to form a cone. This cone is carefully held in the palm and filled with a few spoonfuls of the potato-pea mixture, making sure not to overstuff. The open edge of the cone is then sealed by pressing firmly, creating the triangular pocket. Skilled hands smooth the edges so no filling peeks out, because any opening would let oil seep in while frying.

The samosas are now ready to be fried. Oil is heated in a deep pan, but this part requires patience. If the oil is too hot, the outer crust will brown quickly while the inside remains raw. If it is too cold, the samosas will absorb oil and turn greasy. The trick is to keep the oil at a medium-low heat and fry slowly. The samosas are slid gently into the oil and fried until they turn an even golden brown, crisp and flaky all over. This slow frying is what gives the crust that distinctive crunch, with multiple layers breaking apart delicately when bitten into.

Once fried, the samosas are lifted out and drained on paper towels. They are best served hot, often with green chutney made of coriander and mint, or with tamarind chutney for a sweet-sour contrast. In North India, samosas are also served as chaat, where they are broken into pieces, topped with yogurt, chutneys, sev, and spices, turning them into a full meal.

Samosa fillings themselves are versatile. In some regions, minced meat, like keema, is used instead of potatoes. In South India, onion-filled samosas are popular, while in Bengal, fish or even sweet coconut variations exist. No matter the filling, the principle remains the same—flaky crust on the outside, flavorful filling inside, fried patiently until golden.

The making of a samosa is almost an art form, where care in preparing the dough, balance in spicing the filling, and patience in frying all come together. The result is a snack that has traveled from Persian kitchens centuries ago, adapted into Indian culture, and today is recognized worldwide as a symbol of comfort and indulgence.
