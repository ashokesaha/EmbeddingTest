To make fresh pasta, you begin with flour and eggs. On a clean surface, you pour about two cups of all-purpose flour or “00” Italian flour into a mound. In the center, you make a small well and crack in two large eggs.

With a fork, you slowly mix the eggs into the flour until it forms a dough. Then you knead the dough with your hands for about 8–10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You cover it with a cloth or wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.

After resting, you roll the dough out thin with a rolling pin or pasta machine. Then you cut it into shapes—long strands for spaghetti or fettuccine, or squares for ravioli. The pasta can be cooked right away in boiling salted water for 2–4 minutes until tender.

If you have store-bought pasta, it’s even simpler. You bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a spoon of salt, and then add the pasta. It boils for about 8–12 minutes, depending on the shape, until it is “al dente” (firm but cooked). You then drain the water, keeping a little pasta water aside in case you need it for sauce.

Once pasta is cooked, you mix it with your favorite sauce. For example:

Tomato Sauce (Marinara): Cook garlic and onions in olive oil, add tomatoes, salt, and basil. Simmer into a rich sauce.

Cream Sauce (Alfredo): Melt butter, add cream, garlic, and cheese.

Pesto: Blend basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, and Parmesan into a green paste.

Toss the pasta in the sauce, add cheese on top, and serve hot.
