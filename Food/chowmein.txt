To make chow mein, you first boil some egg noodles or wheat noodles until they are just cooked, then drain them and set them aside. To keep them from sticking, you can toss them lightly in a little oil.

Next, you prepare the vegetables. Common ones are cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, bean sprouts, and spring onions. You slice them thinly so they cook quickly. If you want to add protein, you can use chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu, cut into small pieces.

For the sauce, you mix soy sauce, oyster sauce, a little vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil in a small bowl. This creates the classic savory-sweet chow mein flavor.

Now you heat a wok or a large pan with a little oil. If you are using meat, you stir-fry it first until cooked through, then set it aside. After that, you stir-fry the vegetables quickly on high heat so they stay crisp and colorful.

You then add the noodles to the pan, along with the sauce. Toss everything together, letting the noodles soak up the sauce and mix well with the vegetables. If you cooked meat earlier, you add it back at this stage.

Finally, you sprinkle some chopped spring onions on top, and your chow mein is ready to serve hot.

To begin, you cook some thin egg noodles in boiling water until they are just soft. You drain them well and pat them dry with a towel so there is no extra water.

Next, you heat a little oil in a wide pan. You spread the noodles out evenly in the pan and let them cook without stirring. After a few minutes, the bottom turns golden and crispy. You carefully flip it to crisp the other side as well. Now you have a crispy noodle “cake.” You take it out and place it on a serving plate.

While the noodles rest, you prepare the topping. In a wok, you heat oil and stir-fry sliced chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu until cooked. Then you add vegetables like bok choy, mushrooms, carrots, or bell peppers. You stir-fry them quickly so they stay bright and crisp.

For the sauce, you mix chicken broth, soy sauce, oyster sauce, a little sugar, and cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it. You pour this sauce into the wok and let it simmer until it becomes glossy and coats the meat and vegetables.

Finally, you pour this hot stir-fry with sauce over the crispy noodle cake. The sauce softens part of the noodles while the rest stays crunchy, giving you both textures in one bite.
