Continental food generally refers to the cuisines of Europe, particularly Western and Northern Europe, as opposed to the spicy and heavily flavored foods of Asia or the Middle East. When people say "continental food," they usually mean dishes that originate from countries like France, Italy, Spain, and sometimes Germany and England, which became popular in hotels and restaurants across the world as part of “European-style dining.”

The cuisine is known for being milder in spices compared to Asian food, with more emphasis on dairy, herbs, and wine-based cooking. Butter, cream, olive oil, and cheese are key ingredients, and meats such as chicken, pork, beef, and fish feature prominently. Eggs are also important, both as standalone dishes and in baking.

Vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beans, peas, cabbage, and mushrooms are commonly used, often boiled, grilled, roasted, or added into stews. Grains such as wheat and rice are part of meals, with bread, pasta, and pastries being everyday items. Fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, rosemary, and dill are used for seasoning rather than heavy spices.

Cooking styles in continental food include roasting, grilling, baking, poaching, stewing, and sautéing. Sauces play a major role—classic French sauces such as béchamel, hollandaise, and velouté are the foundation of many continental dishes.

Some well-known continental dishes include French onion soup, ratatouille, quiche, pasta and risotto from Italy, Spanish omelette, paella, steaks with peppercorn sauce, roasted chicken, grilled fish, and a wide variety of breads and desserts such as croissants, soufflés, custards, and tarts.

Dining style is often structured into courses: starters (soups, salads, or appetizers), main courses (meat, fish, or pasta with sides), and desserts (cakes, puddings, pastries). Wine and bread are typical accompaniments.

In short, continental food is elegant, balanced, and often rich, focusing on presentation as much as flavor.
