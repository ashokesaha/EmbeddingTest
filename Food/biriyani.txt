To make biryani, you begin with the rice. Long-grain basmati rice is best. First, you wash it well and soak it for about half an hour so the grains cook fluffy and separate. Then you boil it with a little salt, whole spices like cardamom, cloves, and bay leaf, and cook it until it is just half done. You drain it and keep it aside.

Next, you prepare the meat or vegetables. If you are making chicken or mutton biryani, the meat is marinated with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and sometimes lemon juice. This makes it tender and full of flavor. For a vegetarian version, you can use potatoes, carrots, peas, or paneer, cooked with similar spices.

Now comes the masala. In a big heavy-bottomed pot, onions are sliced thin and fried in oil or ghee until golden brown and crispy. Some of these fried onions are kept aside for garnish later. Into the pot, you add ginger, garlic, tomatoes, green chilies, and more spices—like coriander powder, cumin, cinnamon, and biryani masala. The marinated meat (or vegetables) goes in, and it cooks until the flavors blend together beautifully.

Once the meat is partly cooked, the layering begins. First, a layer of meat and masala is spread at the bottom of the pot. Then a layer of the half-cooked rice is placed on top. Over this, you sprinkle fried onions, fresh coriander leaves, mint leaves, and a drizzle of saffron milk (saffron soaked in warm milk, which gives a golden color and fragrance). A little ghee is also added for richness.

You repeat the layers if you have more rice and masala, finishing with rice on top. The pot is then sealed—traditionally with dough to trap the steam—or tightly covered with a lid. This is called the “dum” method, where the biryani cooks slowly on very low heat. The steam inside cooks the rice and meat fully while letting the flavors mix together.

After about 30–40 minutes, when the lid is lifted, the aroma is heavenly. The rice is fluffy, the meat is tender, and every grain is filled with spice and fragrance. The biryani is served hot, often with raita (yogurt with cucumber and mint) or salad on the side.
