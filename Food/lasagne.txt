To make lasagne, you begin with the sauce. The classic version uses a meat and tomato sauce, sometimes called a ragù. For this, onions and garlic are gently fried in olive oil until soft. Then minced beef or pork is added and browned. Once the meat is cooked, tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs like oregano and basil, and a splash of red wine (optional) are stirred in. This sauce is then simmered slowly so the flavors become deep and rich.

While the ragù cooks, you prepare a creamy white sauce called béchamel. To make this, butter is melted in a pan, flour is stirred in to form a paste, and then warm milk is whisked in slowly until the sauce becomes smooth and thick. A little salt, pepper, and nutmeg make it extra tasty.

Now the layering begins. In a baking dish, you spread a thin layer of ragù first, then place sheets of pasta on top (these can be fresh or dry lasagne sheets). Over the pasta, you add some béchamel sauce, then sprinkle a little grated cheese—mozzarella or Parmesan are most common. You keep repeating these layers: sauce, pasta, béchamel, cheese. Usually, three or four layers make a nice, tall lasagne.

The final layer is special: pasta, a generous amount of béchamel, and lots of cheese sprinkled over the top. The dish then goes into a hot oven, around 180–200°C (350–400°F), and bakes for about 40–50 minutes. The top becomes golden and bubbling, while inside the layers soften and blend together beautifully.

Once baked, it’s important to let the lasagne rest for about 10 minutes before cutting, so it holds its shape. Then you slice into squares and serve it warm—soft pasta, rich sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese in every bite.
