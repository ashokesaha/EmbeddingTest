Mediterranean food refers to the traditional cuisines of the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Lebanon, Morocco, and others. While each country has its own unique dishes, the cuisines share certain common characteristics, ingredients, and cooking styles that make them recognizable as part of the Mediterranean tradition.

The foundation of Mediterranean food is fresh, seasonal, and wholesome ingredients. Olive oil is central to the cuisine and is used for cooking, drizzling, and dressing salads. Fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bell peppers, onions, and leafy greens appear in abundance. Legumes like chickpeas, lentils, and beans are staples, often used in soups, stews, and dips.

Grains such as wheat and rice form an essential part of the diet. Bread, couscous, pasta, and bulgur are common bases for meals. Herbs and spices play a key role, with oregano, rosemary, thyme, parsley, mint, cinnamon, cumin, and saffron adding fragrance and depth to the dishes.

Seafood is popular due to the coastal geography, while lamb, chicken, and goat are common meats. Red meat is eaten less frequently compared to vegetables and legumes. Dairy, especially yogurt and cheeses such as feta, halloumi, and pecorino, adds tang and richness. Nuts and seeds, like almonds, pine nuts, and sesame, are also widely used.

Mediterranean food emphasizes balance and freshness. Dishes often combine raw and cooked elements, such as fresh salads with grilled meats or roasted vegetables. Meals are usually enjoyed slowly, often shared family-style, which is an important cultural aspect.

Some iconic Mediterranean dishes include Greek moussaka and spanakopita, Italian pasta and risotto, Spanish paella and tapas, Turkish kebabs and mezes, Lebanese hummus and tabbouleh, and Moroccan tagines and couscous. Olive oilâ€“dressed salads, fresh bread, and wine often accompany meals.

This cuisine is also associated with the "Mediterranean diet," which has been studied for its health benefits. It is rich in healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and lean proteins, while being lower in processed foods and sugars.
