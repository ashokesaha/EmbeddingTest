Chef John’s Drunken Noodles is a Thai-inspired dish also called Pad Kee Mao. Some say the name comes from it being a favorite late-night food after a few drinks, while others believe it once included wine in the sauce. Whatever the true origin, this recipe is known for being simple to prepare and deeply flavorful, especially when finished with fresh Thai basil.

To make it for four people, you will need eight ounces of dried rice noodles, a quarter cup of oyster sauce, a quarter cup of soy sauce, a tablespoon of Asian fish sauce, a tablespoon of maple syrup, a teaspoon of white sugar, and two tablespoons of cold water. For the cooking, you will use two tablespoons of vegetable oil and one teaspoon of sesame oil. You also need one cup of thinly sliced shallots, six teaspoons of thinly sliced bird’s eye chiles, and four minced garlic cloves. For the main part of the dish, two and a half pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into strips are suggested, along with one pound of sliced Chinese broccoli. Finally, four sliced scallions and one cup of fresh Thai basil leaves are used to finish the dish.

The process begins by soaking the rice noodles in hot but not boiling water for about ten to fifteen minutes, stirring them gently to separate. When they are flexible but not fully soft, drain them and cover with a damp paper towel so they do not dry out. In a small bowl, mix the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar, and water to form the base sauce.

Heat both the vegetable oil and sesame oil together in a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, chiles, and garlic, stirring until the shallots soften, which takes about two minutes. Push this mixture to one side of the pan and place the chicken strips in the empty space. Let them sear for about a minute, then stir them together with the aromatics. Add the stems of the Chinese broccoli and cook until tender, then toss in the leaves and let them wilt. Pour in the sauce mixture with the scallions, stir well, and allow it to come to a simmer. Add the drained noodles and toss everything together so the noodles are coated and absorb the sauce. This takes about two minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the Thai basil leaves until they wilt gently. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, then serve hot.

Chef John notes that this recipe is flexible. Any noodle or even pasta can be used, though soaking and cooking times may vary. The chicken can be replaced with pork, beef, or vegetables as long as the pieces are cut thinly or pre-cooked. If bird’s eye chiles are hard to find, sweet peppers with some red pepper flakes can be used. Thai basil gives the best flavor, but ordinary basil is also a good substitute.
