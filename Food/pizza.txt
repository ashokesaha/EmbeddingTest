To make pizza, you first need to prepare the dough. Take some flour, yeast, warm water, a little sugar, salt, and olive oil. The warm water wakes up the yeast, and the sugar helps it grow. Mix everything together into a soft dough, and knead it well until smooth. Then you leave it in a warm place for about one or two hours, covered, so that it rises and becomes fluffy.

When the dough is ready, you press it down gently and roll it out into a round shape. You can make it thin if you like a crispy base, or keep it thicker for a soft, bread-like base. Place it on a baking tray or a pizza stone.

Now comes the fun part—toppings! First, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough. The sauce is usually made from tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil. Then sprinkle cheese—mozzarella is the most common, because it melts beautifully and stretches when you bite.

After that, you can add anything you like: slices of pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, or even chicken and paneer if you prefer. Some people keep it simple with just cheese and a little basil, known as a classic Margherita pizza.

Once the toppings are ready, the pizza goes into a very hot oven, usually at around 220°C (425°F). It bakes for about 10–15 minutes, until the cheese melts, bubbles, and turns golden, and the crust becomes slightly crisp.

When you take it out, you can drizzle a little olive oil or sprinkle fresh herbs on top. Then slice it into triangles, and it’s ready to eat—hot, cheesy, and delicious.
