Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is one of the most celebrated dishes of Indian cuisine, especially in North India. It has a rich, creamy, and slightly tangy flavor that comes from the interplay of yogurt-marinated chicken, aromatic spices, tomatoes, cream, and, of course, butter. The preparation of butter chicken is a careful balance of two processes: first, marinating and cooking the chicken, and second, creating the luscious gravy that envelops it. Let me describe the full process in detail.

The preparation begins with choosing good quality chicken, often boneless pieces like thighs or breasts, though some prefer bone-in pieces for extra flavor. The chicken is first marinated in a mixture that not only flavors the meat but also tenderizes it. The marinade is made with thick yogurt, which provides creaminess and a slight tang. Into the yogurt go freshly ground ginger and garlic paste, red chili powder or Kashmiri chili powder for a vibrant red color without too much heat, turmeric for warmth, cumin and coriander powder for depth, garam masala for aroma, and salt for balance. A squeeze of lemon juice is often added, which helps tenderize the meat further. This marinade coats the chicken pieces thoroughly, and they are left to rest for at least a few hours, often overnight, so the flavors penetrate deeply.

Once marinated, the chicken is cooked separately before being added to the gravy. Traditionally, the pieces were roasted in a clay tandoor oven, which gave them a smoky, charred flavor, but at home they are usually grilled, broiled, or even shallow-fried until cooked and slightly charred on the edges. The chicken should be juicy inside but lightly crisped outside, as this texture contrasts beautifully with the creamy sauce.

The second part of butter chicken is the sauce or gravy. It starts by heating butter in a pan, and sometimes a little oil is added to prevent the butter from burning. Onions are sautéed until soft and lightly golden, though some recipes keep onions minimal to let the tomato flavor shine. Then ginger-garlic paste is added and fried until the raw smell disappears. To this base, pureed tomatoes are added. These are cooked down until the rawness of the tomatoes is gone and the mixture thickens into a smooth masala.

The spice mix for the gravy usually includes Kashmiri red chili powder for a bright red hue, cumin powder for warmth, coriander powder for earthiness, and garam masala for complexity. The tomato base absorbs these flavors as it simmers. At this stage, cashew paste or almond paste is often added, which gives the sauce its characteristic nutty creaminess. After cooking for some time, fresh cream is stirred in, softening the tang of the tomatoes and creating that silky, buttery texture. More butter is added toward the end to enrich the sauce and give it the velvety finish that defines the dish.

Now the pre-cooked chicken pieces are added into this gravy. They simmer gently, soaking in the flavors of the sauce. The chicken, already spiced from the marinade, now becomes tender as it absorbs the creamy tomato-butter blend. A final sprinkle of dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) is added, which is essential for butter chicken’s signature aroma.

The dish is finished with an extra swirl of cream and a pat of butter on top before serving. The result is a balance of flavors—the smokiness of the chicken, the tanginess of tomatoes, the richness of cream and butter, and the aroma of spices, all coming together into a dish that is both comforting and indulgent.

Butter chicken is usually paired with naan, roti, or other flatbreads, which soak up the sauce beautifully, though it also goes very well with fragrant basmati rice or jeera rice.

What makes butter chicken special is how it transforms basic ingredients into something royal. The yogurt marinade ensures tender chicken, the tomato-cream gravy gives a luxurious texture, and the butter ties everything together. It is a dish that represents the Mughlai influence in Indian cooking and has traveled the world as one of India’s culinary ambassadors.
