To make enchiladas, you begin with the filling. Cooked chicken, beef, beans, or vegetables can be used. If you’re making chicken enchiladas, you shred boiled or roasted chicken. Then you cook it with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and spices like cumin, chili powder, and oregano until it becomes flavorful.

Next, you prepare the sauce. A classic red enchilada sauce is made by frying onions and garlic in oil, then adding tomato puree, chili powder, cumin, and broth. It simmers until thick and rich. Some people also use green sauce made with tomatillos and green chilies.

Now you take soft corn tortillas. To keep them from breaking, you warm them slightly in a pan or dip them briefly in hot oil. Then you place a spoonful of filling in the center of each tortilla, roll it up tightly, and place it seam-side down in a baking dish.

When all the tortillas are rolled and arranged, you pour the enchilada sauce generously over the top. Then you sprinkle a good layer of cheese — cheddar, Monterey Jack, or queso fresco.

The dish goes into a hot oven at about 180°C (350°F) for 20–25 minutes. The cheese melts, the sauce bubbles, and the tortillas soak up all the flavors.

Once baked, you take them out and garnish with fresh coriander, sour cream, or chopped onions. They are served hot, usually with rice and beans on the side.
