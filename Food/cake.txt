To make a cake, you begin by preparing the batter. First, take some butter and sugar, and beat them together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This step makes the cake soft. Then you crack in eggs, one at a time, and keep mixing so they blend smoothly.

Next, you sift flour and baking powder together, sometimes with a little pinch of salt. You slowly add this dry mixture into the butter-egg mix, alternating with some milk. This keeps the batter smooth and not too thick. If you like, you can add vanilla essence for flavor.

Once the batter is ready, you pour it into a greased cake tin. The oven is preheated to about 180°C (350°F), and the cake is baked for around 30–40 minutes. While baking, the cake rises, turns golden, and fills the kitchen with a sweet smell.

To check if it is done, you insert a toothpick or knife in the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. After baking, you let it cool a little before removing it from the tin.

You can enjoy the cake just like that, plain and warm. Or, if you like, you can decorate it with cream, chocolate, fruits, or icing. That turns a simple sponge cake into a celebration cake!
