To make quesadillas, you start with tortillas. Traditionally, corn tortillas are used in Mexico, but flour tortillas are also popular.

You heat a flat pan or skillet and place one tortilla on it. While it warms, you sprinkle a good amount of grated cheese over one half of the tortilla. Cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, or Mexican cheeses like Oaxaca or Chihuahua work well.

If you want extra flavor, you can also add cooked chicken, beef, mushrooms, beans, peppers, or onions along with the cheese.

Then you fold the tortilla in half, pressing it gently so the filling stays inside. You cook it on one side until the tortilla turns golden and crispy, then flip it to cook the other side. The cheese inside melts and becomes gooey.

Once both sides are golden, you remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it into wedges. It is usually served with salsa, guacamole, or sour cream on the side.
