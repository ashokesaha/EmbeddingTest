To make dosa, you first prepare the batter. You take rice and split urad dal (a type of white lentil). The rice and dal are washed well and soaked in water for a few hours, usually 4–6 hours. Sometimes a little fenugreek seed is added to help fermentation.

After soaking, the rice and dal are ground separately into a smooth paste, using some water. Then both pastes are mixed together in a big bowl. The batter should be slightly thick but pourable. It is left overnight (8–10 hours) in a warm place to ferment. By morning, the batter rises and becomes airy, with a mild sour smell.

Now it is ready to cook. A flat pan or skillet is heated, and a few drops of oil are spread lightly. A ladle of batter is poured in the center and spread in a circular motion to form a thin, round layer. As it cooks, the edges turn golden and crisp. A little oil or ghee is drizzled around the edges for extra taste.

If you want a plain dosa, you simply fold it and serve. If you want masala dosa, you place a filling of spiced mashed potatoes in the center before folding. The dosa is served hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar (a lentil and vegetable stew).

The result is a light, crispy dosa with soft inside layers, perfect for breakfast or dinner.
