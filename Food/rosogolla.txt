Rosogolla, or rasgulla as it is often spelled outside Bengal, is one of the most beloved sweets in Bengal and Odisha, and its preparation is both delicate and fascinating. To understand it in detail, let me walk you through the entire process step by step in flowing sentences, without points, so that you can picture it being made.

The journey of rosogolla begins with fresh milk. Full-fat cow’s milk is preferred because the richness of the milk fat helps in creating soft, spongy balls. The milk is brought to a gentle boil in a wide, heavy-bottomed vessel. Once it reaches a steady boil, a souring agent such as lemon juice or vinegar diluted in water is added gradually. As the souring liquid mixes in, the milk begins to curdle, separating into white curds and a pale greenish whey. This curdling must be done carefully; the milk should split completely, but the curds should remain soft and not rubbery, which is why the souring agent is usually diluted.

Once the milk has fully curdled, it is poured over a muslin or fine cotton cloth set on a strainer. The cloth gathers all the curds, which are then rinsed under cool running water. Rinsing is important because it washes away the acidic taste of lemon or vinegar that could otherwise interfere with the final flavor. The cloth is then tied into a bundle and hung for some time to let excess water drain. What remains inside is fresh, soft chhena, the base of most Bengali sweets. The chhena should be moist but not watery; if it dries out too much, the rosogolla will turn hard.

Now comes the most critical part: kneading the chhena. It is placed on a smooth surface and gently kneaded with the heel of the palm. The kneading should not be rushed; it is done slowly until the chhena becomes smooth and releases just a hint of fat, forming a soft, pliable dough. The texture here determines the sponginess of the rosogolla. When the chhena is ready, it is divided into small equal portions and rolled between the palms into smooth, crack-free balls. Any crack on the surface can cause the balls to break during cooking, so achieving perfectly round, glossy spheres is an art in itself.

Meanwhile, in a large wide pot, sugar syrup is prepared. Equal parts of sugar and water are boiled together, and sometimes a few drops of rose water, cardamom, or even a touch of saffron are added for fragrance, although traditional Bengali rosogolla usually focuses on the pure sweetness without extra flavorings. The syrup must be thin and watery rather than thick, because the rosogolla needs space to expand and absorb the syrup.

Once the syrup is bubbling, the chhena balls are gently slipped into the boiling liquid. They must be cooked on steady high heat so that the syrup remains boiling vigorously. The heat creates pressure inside the syrup, which helps the balls expand as they absorb the liquid, becoming light and spongy. As they cook, the balls begin to swell and turn glossy, floating to the surface. To ensure even cooking, the lid of the pot is kept tightly closed, allowing steam to maintain pressure. Sometimes cooks sprinkle a spoonful of water into the syrup to prevent crystallization and to maintain the right texture.

The cooking usually takes about twenty minutes, during which the rosogollas nearly double in size. Once done, they are allowed to rest in the same syrup, soaking in the sweetness. When served, they are soft to the touch, springy when pressed, and filled with syrup that bursts out in the mouth with each bite.

That is how the classic Bengali rosogolla is prepared, a sweet that looks deceptively simple but requires a careful balance of technique and patience at every step, from curdling the milk to kneading the chhena to controlling the syrup’s consistency and heat.


One of the first mistakes happens at the stage of curdling the milk. If the lemon juice or vinegar is added in excess or too suddenly, the curds become hard and grainy, which makes the final rosogolla dense. To avoid this, the souring agent should always be diluted with water and added gradually, stirring gently until the milk separates. Another problem can occur if the curds are not rinsed properly. The acidic taste left behind will not only spoil the flavor but also interfere with the softness of the chhena. Rinsing thoroughly under cool water removes this sharpness.

Draining the chhena also requires care. If it is left hanging for too long, it will lose too much moisture and become dry, resulting in hard rosogolla. If it is too wet, the dough will be sticky and fall apart while shaping. The right balance is when the chhena feels soft and moist but not watery; pressing it lightly should not release any liquid.

Kneading is perhaps the most critical step where many go wrong. Some people under-knead, leaving the chhena grainy, which produces rosogollas with a coarse texture that do not expand well. Others over-knead until the chhena releases too much fat and becomes greasy, leading to flattened or rubbery sweets. The dough should be kneaded just enough to turn smooth and pliable, with a light sheen of fat appearing.

Shaping also matters. If the balls are not perfectly smooth and round, cracks may develop, and they will break apart during boiling. Rolling them gently but firmly until they are glossy ensures they hold their shape in the syrup.

When cooking in sugar syrup, some people make it too thick, almost like a sticky syrup, which prevents the balls from expanding. Others make it too watery, causing the rosogollas to become bland. The syrup should be thin, just sweet enough, and kept at a rolling boil. The cooking pot should also be wide enough so the rosogollas have space to expand without crowding or sticking together.

Another mistake is not maintaining steady high heat during boiling. If the syrup is allowed to cool or simmer gently, the pressure that makes the rosogollas puff up is lost, and they remain small and dense. Keeping the pot covered and the syrup vigorously boiling is the secret to that airy, spongy texture.

Finally, once they are cooked, some people immediately transfer them into cold syrup or water, which shocks them and makes them collapse. It’s best to let them rest in the same warm syrup, slowly absorbing sweetness and stabilizing their structure.

In short, making rosogolla is like a dance of precision—each step requires attention to balance moisture, texture, and heat. When all these details come together, the result is the perfect soft, spongy ball that bursts with syrup in the mouth.
