Jalebi is one of the most delightful sweets of the Indian subcontinent, known for its golden spirals, crisp texture, and juicy sweetness. Though it looks intricate, its preparation is a combination of simple steps done with care and patience. Let me take you through the process in detail, almost like a story unfolding in the kitchen.

The journey starts with preparing the batter, which forms the base of jalebi. Traditionally, a mixture of all-purpose flour, a little gram flour, yogurt, and water is whisked together into a smooth, lump-free paste. The consistency should neither be too runny nor too thick, but something like pancake batter, where it can flow freely but still hold some body. To this batter, a touch of turmeric or saffron-infused water is sometimes added for that golden hue, though many recipes rely on frying alone to give the color. The batter is then covered and left to ferment for several hours, often overnight. This fermentation is what gives jalebi its slightly tangy taste, a signature balance to its intense sweetness.

While the batter rests, attention shifts to the sugar syrup, or chashni, which is the soul of jalebi. Sugar and water are boiled together until the syrup becomes slightly sticky but not too thick. If it is too watery, the jalebi will not soak properly, and if it is too dense, the jalebi will become hard and overly chewy. To test, a drop of the syrup between two fingers should form a single thin thread when pulled apart. For flavor, cardamom, rose water, or saffron strands can be infused, giving the syrup a fragrance that makes the jalebi more inviting. The syrup is kept warm, never cold, because jalebis must be dipped immediately after frying.

When the batter has fermented, it is poured into a cloth with a small nozzle, a piping bag, or even a squeeze bottle, depending on what the cook prefers. Traditionally, a muslin cloth with a tiny hole in the center was used. The challenge and artistry of jalebi lie in shaping the batter into neat concentric circles or spirals directly into hot oil. The oil or ghee is heated until moderately hot, not smoking, because if it is too hot, the jalebi will brown too quickly without cooking through, and if it is too cool, the batter will spread out and lose shape.

With steady hands, the batter is squeezed out in quick circular motions, forming tight spirals or overlapping loops. As soon as they hit the oil, the jalebis begin to puff slightly and hold their shape. They are fried until crisp and golden on both sides, turned gently with tongs to avoid breaking. The key is to achieve a delicate crunch while keeping the inside slightly soft.

Once fried, the jalebis are lifted straight from the oil and immediately dipped into the warm sugar syrup. They should rest in the syrup just long enough to absorb sweetness but not so long that they become soggy. A minute or two of soaking is usually enough. As they come out, they glisten with syrup, sticky, crisp, and aromatic.

The finished jalebis are best enjoyed hot, when the contrast of crunch and juiciness is at its peak. They are often paired with a glass of warm milk, rabri, or even savory snacks like samosas and kachoris, making them a versatile treat for festivals, breakfasts, or evening indulgence.

The magic of jalebi lies in this delicate balance of fermentation, frying, and syrup soaking. Too much or too little in any step, and the texture will falter, but when done right, they are spirals of pure joy, melting crispness giving way to sweet, fragrant syrup in every bite.

One of the closest cousins of jalebi in India is imarti, which you will often find in Uttar Pradesh and parts of North India. Unlike jalebi that is made from all-purpose flour, imarti is prepared with ground urad dal, or black gram lentils. The batter is thicker, and the spirals are larger, with a flower-like design rather than tight circles. Imarti tends to be more chewy and dense compared to the crisp, light jalebi, and it has a rich, earthy flavor because of the lentils. The syrup is often scented with cardamom or rose, making imarti a slightly more robust sweet.

In Bengal and Odisha, a variation called chhena jalebi or paneer jalebi is loved by many. Here the batter is replaced entirely with fresh chhena, the same curdled milk base used for rasgulla or sandesh. The chhena dough is shaped into rings, fried, and soaked in syrup. These jalebis are softer, richer, and almost melt in the mouth, tasting more like a cross between jalebi and gulab jamun.

In Madhya Pradesh and parts of Gujarat, people enjoy mawa jalebi, which uses khoya or thickened milk solids in the batter. This gives a deeper, creamier taste, and the jalebis are slightly heavier, often paired with rabri for festivals like Diwali. They are golden, soft inside, and absolutely indulgent.

Across the Middle East, there is a very old variation known as zalabiya or zulbia, from which the Indian jalebi itself is believed to have descended. In Iran, zalabiya is a Ramadan special, made with a batter of flour, yogurt, and sometimes saffron, fried into irregular net-like shapes and soaked in fragrant syrup with rose water. They are often served alongside another sweet called bamiyeh.

In North Africa, you will find a sweet called zlabia during Ramadan as well, particularly in Algeria and Tunisia. The shapes are less uniform, but the spirit is the sameâ€”crispy, sticky, and syrup-soaked.

In some regions of South India, there is a preference for jangiri, which looks like jalebi but is closer to imarti. It is made with urad dal, piped into more intricate, floral spirals, and it tends to be slightly less tangy since fermentation is not always emphasized.

So, while the jalebi that most of us know is the bright orange, crisp spirals sold at sweet shops and fairs, its variations tell a story of cultural exchange and local adaptation. From the lentil-based imarti to the paneer-rich chhena jalebi, from creamy mawa jalebi to the Persian zalabiya, each has its own place in festive traditions and everyday enjoyment.
