How to tell when the salmon is done: “Salmon will change from translucent (red or raw) to opaque (pink) as it cooks. After 6-8 minutes of cooking, check for doneness, by taking a sharp knife to peek into the thickest part. If the meat is beginning to flake, but still has a little translucency in the middle, it is done.” (Thank you Heidi!) I know this is the proper way to cook salmon, but I am also slightly paranoid about food safety, so the salmon we cook at home has almost no translucency when done. If the rare center freaks you out, don’t worry – it’s still very, very delicious when cooked all the way through (just don’t let it get WAY overcooked or it will be dry and sad).

How much salmon to use: I don’t really care for leftover salmon, so I usually opt for a smaller filet – something like 1 – 1/2 lbs. so that we can eat it once or twice without a lot of leftovers. A 2 lb. filet will serve 4-6 people easily, especially when combined with rice, mango avocado salsa, etc.

Do you use fresh or frozen mangoes: Fresh is the most delicious. But frozen chunks can also work! Just let them thaw out on the counter and then give them a little extra knife treatment so they’re good for salsa-size.

What else does this salmon go with: You can also add any other vegetables you like to build out your bowls (totally optional). I used some of my leftover Korean BBQ style cauliflower in there and it was SO yummy. I’ve also added roasted vegetables like mushrooms and asparagus. 

Air-Frying Your Salmon: I’d just use the salmon in this Air Fryer Salmon as the spices are very similar!
