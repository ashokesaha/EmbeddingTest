To make sushi, you begin with a special kind of short-grain rice. The rice is washed carefully many times until the water runs clear, so that it is not too sticky. Then it is cooked gently in water until soft and fluffy. While the rice is still warm, you mix in rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. This makes the rice shiny, slightly tangy, and just sticky enough to hold together. The rice must cool a little before you can use it.

Next, you prepare the fillings. If you are using fish, it must be very fresh and sliced thinly. You can also use shrimp, crab sticks, or even just vegetables like avocado, cucumber, or carrots. Some people also make a thin omelet and cut it into strips for sushi.

For nigiri, you wet your hands in a little water with vinegar so the rice won’t stick. You take a small ball of rice, shape it into a neat oval, and place a slice of fish on top. Sometimes a tiny dab of wasabi goes between the rice and the fish. You press it gently so it holds together.

For sushi rolls, you place a sheet of dried seaweed on a bamboo mat. A thin layer of rice is spread over the seaweed, leaving a small strip uncovered at the top. Then you lay your fillings—like fish, avocado, or cucumber—across the middle. Using the mat, you roll it up tightly into a cylinder. With a wet, sharp knife, you cut the roll into bite-sized pieces.

Sushi can also be made in other forms, like inside-out rolls where the rice is on the outside, or hand rolls shaped like cones. Once ready, sushi is served with soy sauce for dipping, wasabi for a bit of spice, and pickled ginger to refresh the mouth between bites.

In the end, sushi is not only about taste but also about balance and presentation—simple, delicate, and beautiful on the plate.
