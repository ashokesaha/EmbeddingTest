To make a burrito, you start with a large, soft flour tortilla. This will be your wrap, so it needs to be big enough to hold all the fillings. Warm it slightly in a pan or on a skillet so it becomes soft and flexible.

For the filling, you usually need rice, beans, meat or vegetables, and some extras. The rice is cooked with a little salt or sometimes with lime and cilantro to make it fragrant. The beans—black beans or pinto beans—are either boiled or cooked from a can, often mashed slightly with spices like cumin and chili powder.

If you want meat, you can cook chicken, beef, or pork with garlic, onions, and spices such as paprika, chili powder, and oregano until juicy and tender. If you prefer vegetarian, you can use sautéed vegetables like peppers, corn, or zucchini instead.

Now you start building the burrito. Lay the warm tortilla flat, then spread a layer of rice in the center. On top of that, add some beans, then the meat or veggies. After that, sprinkle cheese, add salsa, guacamole, sour cream, or lettuce—whatever you like.

Once the fillings are in, fold the sides of the tortilla inward, then roll it tightly from the bottom upwards, keeping the filling tucked in. You should end up with a neat, closed wrap. Some people like to toast the burrito on a hot pan for a few minutes to make the outside slightly crisp and the cheese inside melty.

Finally, you slice it in half (or just hold it whole) and enjoy a warm, flavorful burrito filled with all the goodness inside.
