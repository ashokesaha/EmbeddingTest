To make momos, you first prepare the dough. In a large bowl, you take plain flour and a pinch of salt. You slowly add water and knead it into a smooth, soft dough. You cover it with a cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.

While the dough rests, you prepare the filling. For vegetable momos, you finely chop cabbage, carrots, onions, garlic, and spring onions. You mix them with soy sauce, a little oil, salt, and pepper. If you want chicken or meat momos, you mix minced chicken or meat with onions, garlic, ginger, coriander, and spices.

Once the filling is ready, you roll the dough into small balls and flatten each one into a thin round circle. In the center of each circle, you place a spoonful of filling. You then fold the edges and pinch them together in pleats to form a dumpling shape — either round or half-moon.

Next, you place the momos in a steamer lined with a little oil or cabbage leaves so they don’t stick. You steam them for about 10–12 minutes, until the dough looks soft and slightly shiny.

Finally, you serve the hot momos with a spicy tomato-garlic chutney or chili sauce.
