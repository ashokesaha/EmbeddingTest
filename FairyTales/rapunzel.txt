A long time ago, a man and his wife lived next to a garden belonging to a wicked witch. The wife longed to taste the rampion (a type of herb) growing there. Her husband, desperate to please her, sneaked into the garden to pick some. The witch caught him and demanded, in return, their firstborn child. Terrified, the man agreed.

When their daughter was born, the witch took her away and named her Rapunzel. She grew into a beautiful girl with long, golden hair. The witch locked her in a tall tower with no stairs or door — only a window at the very top. Whenever the witch came, she would call, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!” and climb up the golden braid.

One day, a prince riding through the forest heard Rapunzel singing from her tower. Enchanted, he watched and learned how the witch climbed up. The next day, he too called, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!” and was pulled up. Rapunzel was frightened at first, but soon she and the prince grew to love each other.

They planned to escape together, but the witch discovered their secret. In her rage, she cut off Rapunzel’s beautiful hair and banished her deep into the wilderness. When the prince came to the tower, the witch let down Rapunzel’s cut braid and tricked him. At the top, she revealed the truth and pushed him from the tower. He fell into thorns, which blinded him.

For years, the prince wandered blindly, searching for Rapunzel. At last, he heard her voice in the desert, singing just as she had in the tower. They ran into each other’s arms. As she wept with joy, her tears touched his eyes — and miraculously, his sight was restored.

Together, they returned to his kingdom, where they lived happily ever after.
