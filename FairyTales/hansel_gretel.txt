Once upon a time, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children, Hansel and Gretel. Times were so hard that there was often not enough food. The stepmother, who was selfish and cruel, decided to abandon the children in the forest so she and her husband would have more to eat. The woodcutter reluctantly agreed.

But Hansel, who was clever, overheard their plan. That night, he collected shiny white pebbles and, as they walked into the forest, dropped them along the path. After being left behind, he and Gretel followed the trail of pebbles back home.

Angry, the stepmother plotted again. This time, Hansel tried to use breadcrumbs to mark the path, but the birds ate them all. The children were lost in the deep, dark forest.

After wandering for days, they came upon a cottage made entirely of gingerbread, cakes, and candy. Hungry and amazed, they began to eat it. Suddenly, an old woman appeared and invited them inside. But she was no kind lady — she was a wicked witch who lured children with her sweet house to eat them! She locked Hansel in a cage to fatten him up and made Gretel her servant.

The witch checked Hansel each day to see if he was plump enough to cook, but clever Hansel held out a thin bone through the bars, and the near-blind witch thought he was still skinny. At last, growing impatient, the witch decided to cook him anyway. She ordered Gretel to climb into the oven to test the fire.

Quick-thinking Gretel pretended not to know how. When the witch leaned in to show her, Gretel pushed her into the oven and slammed the door shut. The witch was gone forever. The children searched the house and found treasure — gold and jewels hidden inside. With their pockets full, they found their way back home.

Their father welcomed them with tears of joy, for the cruel stepmother had died. From then on, Hansel, Gretel, and their father lived happily, never knowing hunger again.
