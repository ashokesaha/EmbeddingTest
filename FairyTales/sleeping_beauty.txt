Long ago, a king and queen wished for a child. At last, a baby daughter was born, and they named her Aurora. To celebrate, they held a grand feast and invited fairies from all over the kingdom to bless the child with gifts. Each fairy gave the baby a special blessing — beauty, grace, kindness, and song.

But one fairy, who had been forgotten and not invited, arrived in anger. She declared a terrible curse: “On her sixteenth birthday, the princess shall prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep from which she will never wake!” The court gasped. Luckily, one gentle fairy still had her gift left to give. She softened the curse: “The princess will indeed fall into a deep sleep, but she shall not die. She will sleep until awakened by true love’s kiss.”

Despite the king’s orders to destroy every spinning wheel in the land, fate could not be stopped. On Aurora’s sixteenth birthday, she wandered into a hidden tower where an old woman (the disguised wicked fairy) sat spinning. Curious, Aurora touched the spindle and pricked her finger. At once, she fell into a deep sleep, and so did the entire kingdom — the king, the queen, and all the people — as the fairy had foretold. A thick forest of thorns grew around the castle, hiding it for many years.

One day, a brave prince heard the tale of the sleeping princess. He fought his way through the thorny forest, reached the silent castle, and at last found Aurora lying peacefully in her chamber. Overcome by her beauty, he gently kissed her. At that moment, the curse was broken. Aurora awoke, and so did the entire kingdom.

The king and queen rejoiced, the people celebrated, and soon Aurora and the prince were married. They lived happily ever after, their love stronger than any curse.
