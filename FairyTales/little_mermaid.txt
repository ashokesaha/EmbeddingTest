In the deep blue sea, far beneath the waves, lived a young mermaid princess who longed to see the human world. She often swam to the surface to watch ships sail by, dreaming of life on land.

One stormy night, she saw a shipwreck and rescued a handsome prince from drowning. She carried him to the shore and stayed until he was safe, though he never saw her. From that day on, she loved him deeply.

Yearning to be with him, she visited the sea witch, who offered her a potion to turn her tail into legs. But the price was high — she would lose her beautiful voice, and if the prince married another, she would die and turn into sea foam. Still, the mermaid agreed, drank the potion, and became human.

On land, she found the prince, who was kind to her though she could not speak. They spent happy days together, but the prince believed another woman had saved him during the shipwreck, and he chose to marry her instead.

Heartbroken, the little mermaid’s sisters brought her a dagger from the sea witch. If she killed the prince, she could return to the sea. But the mermaid loved him too much to harm him. Instead, she threw herself into the sea, where she dissolved into foam. Yet, because of her selfless love, she was transformed into a spirit of the air, given the chance to earn a soul through good deeds.
