Long ago, in a faraway city, there lived a poor young man named Aladdin. He and his mother struggled to make a living. One day, a mysterious stranger appeared, claiming to be Aladdin’s long-lost uncle. In truth, he was a wicked sorcerer from a distant land, but Aladdin did not know this.

The sorcerer promised to make Aladdin rich if he helped him with a task. He led him deep into the desert to a hidden cave. At the entrance, he gave Aladdin a special ring for protection and told him to go inside. Inside the cave, Aladdin found it filled with glittering treasures. Among them was an old, dusty oil lamp. The sorcerer demanded the lamp, but when Aladdin hesitated, the sorcerer grew angry and trapped him inside the cave.

Desperate and frightened, Aladdin rubbed his hands together — and accidentally rubbed the lamp. To his astonishment, a powerful genie appeared in a flash of smoke and thunder! The genie declared, “I am the servant of the lamp. Whatever you wish, I shall grant.” With the genie’s help, Aladdin escaped the cave and returned home with the lamp.

From then on, Aladdin’s life changed. The genie granted him food, riches, and fine clothes. Soon, he fell in love with the sultan’s beautiful daughter, Princess Badroulbadour. With the genie’s help, Aladdin built a magnificent palace and won the princess’s heart. They were married in great splendor.

But the wicked sorcerer had not given up. He returned, disguised as a merchant, and tricked the princess into exchanging the “old lamp” for a new one, not knowing its power. With the lamp in his hands, the sorcerer commanded the genie to carry Aladdin’s palace — and the princess — far away.

When Aladdin discovered what had happened, he was heartbroken. But then he remembered the magic ring the sorcerer had given him in the cave. He rubbed it, and another genie appeared — less powerful than the lamp’s genie, but still able to help. With the ring’s aid, Aladdin traveled to the far-off land where the sorcerer had taken his palace.

Using his wits, Aladdin defeated the sorcerer, reclaimed the lamp, and freed the princess. With the genie’s help, they returned the palace to its rightful place. The sultan, grateful for Aladdin’s bravery and loyalty, declared him the heir to the throne.

From then on, Aladdin and Princess Badroulbadour lived happily in peace and prosperity, guarded by the magic of the lamp.
