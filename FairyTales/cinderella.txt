Cinderella was a sweet and gentle girl who lost her mother at a young age. Her father later remarried, but soon he too passed away, leaving Cinderella under the care of her stepmother and two stepsisters. Instead of treating her like family, they forced her to do all the housework — sweeping, scrubbing, cooking — while they lived in comfort. Because her clothes were always covered in ashes, they mockingly called her “Cinderella.”

One day, the king announced that a grand ball would be held so that the prince might choose a bride. Every young woman in the kingdom was invited. The stepsisters were excited and spent days preparing their gowns, while Cinderella secretly dreamed of going too. But her stepmother laughed at the idea and forbade her to attend.

On the night of the ball, after her family had gone, Cinderella sat weeping in the kitchen. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared. With a wave of her magic wand, she transformed Cinderella’s rags into a dazzling gown, gave her a pair of sparkling glass slippers, and turned a pumpkin into a golden carriage with horses. But she warned, “You must return before midnight, for the magic will end then.”

At the ball, Cinderella’s beauty astonished everyone. The prince danced only with her, and they talked as if they had known each other forever. But as the clock struck midnight, Cinderella remembered the warning. She hurried away, leaving behind one glass slipper in her haste.

The next day, the prince declared he would marry the woman whose foot fit the slipper. He traveled across the kingdom, but none of the young women could wear it. When he arrived at Cinderella’s home, her stepsisters tried desperately to squeeze their feet into the slipper, but it was no use. Then Cinderella shyly asked if she might try. To everyone’s shock, the slipper fit perfectly.

Her fairy godmother’s magic revealed her once more in her dazzling gown, and the prince recognized her as the mysterious girl from the ball. Overjoyed, he married her soon after. Cinderella forgave her stepsisters for their cruelty, and she began a new life filled with kindness, love, and happiness with the prince.
