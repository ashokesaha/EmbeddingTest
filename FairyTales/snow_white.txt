Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess named Snow White. Her skin was as white as snow, her lips as red as a rose, and her hair as black as ebony. Her stepmother, the queen, was proud and vain. She often asked her magic mirror, “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?” and the mirror always replied, “You, O Queen, are the fairest of them all.”

But as Snow White grew older, her beauty surpassed the queen’s. One day, the mirror answered, “Snow White is the fairest of them all.” The queen’s heart burned with jealousy. She ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. But the kind huntsman couldn’t harm the innocent girl. Instead, he let her go and told her to run away.

Lost and frightened, Snow White wandered deep into the forest until she came upon a small cottage. Inside, she found seven tiny chairs, seven little plates, and seven neat beds. Exhausted, she lay down and fell asleep. The cottage belonged to seven dwarfs who worked in the mines. When they returned home, they discovered the princess and decided to let her stay. Snow White quickly became like family to them — cooking, cleaning, and sharing her kindness.

Meanwhile, the queen discovered that Snow White was still alive. Furious, she disguised herself as an old woman and prepared a poisoned apple. She traveled to the dwarfs’ cottage and offered the apple to Snow White. Trusting the old woman, Snow White took a bite — and instantly fell into a deep, death-like sleep.

The dwarfs were heartbroken. They placed her gently in a glass coffin, refusing to bury her because she still looked so beautiful, as if only asleep. One day, a prince passed through the forest and saw Snow White in the coffin. Struck by her beauty, he asked to take her with him. As his servants lifted the coffin, the piece of poisoned apple fell from her throat, and Snow White awoke as if from a long dream.

The prince rejoiced, and soon he and Snow White were married. The evil queen, when she learned of this, was filled with rage, but her power was broken, and she never troubled them again. Snow White and her prince lived happily ever after, surrounded by love and joy.
