Once upon a time, a wealthy merchant lost all his riches and had to move to the countryside with his children. Among them was his youngest daughter, Beauty, who was kind, gentle, and loved by all.

One day, the merchant heard that one of his ships had returned with goods, so he went to the city. Before leaving, he asked his daughters what gifts they would like. The elder daughters asked for fine clothes and jewels, but Beauty asked only for a single rose.

On his way back, the merchant lost his way in a forest and stumbled upon a grand, enchanted castle. Inside, he found food and shelter, but no master. In the garden, he plucked a rose for Beauty. Suddenly, a fearsome Beast appeared. Angered at the theft, the Beast demanded the merchant’s life. Terrified, the merchant begged for mercy. The Beast agreed to spare him on one condition: one of his daughters must come to live in the castle willingly.

When the merchant returned home, Beauty bravely offered to go in his place. At first, she was afraid of the Beast, but he treated her kindly. Day by day, she discovered his gentle heart, and they became close friends. Each night, the Beast asked her to marry him, and each night she gently refused, though she cared for him deeply.

One day, Beauty grew worried about her father’s health. The Beast allowed her to visit home but made her promise to return. Beauty stayed longer than she meant to, and when she finally hurried back, she found the Beast lying weak and dying of grief. Overcome with sorrow, she realized how much she loved him. With tears in her eyes, she whispered, “I love you, Beast. I will marry you.”

At that very moment, the Beast transformed into a handsome prince. The spell was broken — he had been cursed, and only true love could set him free. Beauty and the prince were married, and they lived together happily ever after.
