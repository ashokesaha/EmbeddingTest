The Latin American independence movements unfolded during the early nineteenth century and together created a wave that swept across an entire continent. For three centuries, most of Latin America had been under the rule of Spain and Portugal. The colonies were rich in resources like silver, gold, and fertile land, but their wealth flowed to Europe, while the majority of the population—indigenous peoples, Africans, and mixed communities—lived under oppression and rigid hierarchies. At the top were the peninsulares, Europeans born in Spain or Portugal who dominated political and economic life. Below them were the creoles, people of European descent born in the Americas, who had wealth and education but were excluded from the highest offices. Resentment had been building among creoles for decades, and when revolutionary ideas of liberty, equality, and self-rule spread from the American and French revolutions, and when Haiti proved that even enslaved people could break free, Latin America became ripe for change.

The spark came with the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. In 1808, Napoleon invaded Spain and placed his brother on the Spanish throne. This created a crisis of legitimacy: if Spain itself was occupied, what authority did it have to rule its colonies? Across Latin America, local juntas, or councils, were formed to govern in the name of the deposed Spanish king, but soon these councils became centers of revolutionary activity. The creoles began to see an opportunity to establish independence, not just temporary self-rule.

One of the greatest leaders of this era was Simón Bolívar, a Venezuelan revolutionary often called “El Libertador.” Inspired by Enlightenment thought and the example of earlier revolutions, Bolívar dedicated his life to freeing northern South America from Spanish control. He fought in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, enduring repeated defeats but always returning to the struggle with determination. Bolívar’s dream was not only independence but also the creation of a unified, strong Latin American federation that could stand equal to Europe. Though his vision of unity eventually failed, his campaigns laid the foundation for independent republics across the region.

In the south, another great figure, José de San Martín, led independence struggles in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. A skilled military leader, San Martín crossed the Andes with his army in one of the most daring campaigns of the era, defeating Spanish forces in Chile and later moving into Peru. For a brief time, Bolívar and San Martín worked toward the same goal, though they had different visions for the future of Latin America. San Martín eventually withdrew, leaving Bolívar to continue the fight in Peru.

Mexico’s path to independence took a different form. In 1810, a priest named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang his church bell and called on the people to rise against Spanish rule in what became known as the “Grito de Dolores.” His movement was fueled by peasants, indigenous people, and mestizos, though it was brutally suppressed. Another priest, José María Morelos, carried the struggle forward until he too was executed. Finally, in 1821, after more than a decade of conflict, Mexico secured independence under the leadership of Agustín de Iturbide, who at first fought for Spain but later joined the revolutionaries.

Elsewhere, independence movements erupted across Central America, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Brazil’s story was unique because it avoided much of the violence seen elsewhere. When Napoleon invaded Portugal, the Portuguese royal family fled to Brazil and ruled from there. Later, when the king returned to Portugal, his son Dom Pedro stayed behind. In 1822, he declared Brazil’s independence and became its first emperor, making Brazil the only Latin American country to achieve independence with relatively little bloodshed.

By the mid-1820s, Spanish power in the Americas was broken. Nation after nation declared itself free, creating a new political map of the Western Hemisphere. Yet independence did not mean equality for all. Indigenous people, enslaved Africans, and the poor often found that the old social hierarchies remained intact. Many new nations struggled with instability, divisions, and foreign pressures, but the movements had forever broken the hold of European empires over Latin America.

The Latin American independence struggles were part of a global age of revolutions. They carried forward the spirit of liberty that began in America, spread in France, and was vindicated in Haiti. They transformed a continent, giving birth to new nations and a sense of identity rooted in resistance and resilience. Though their promises were only partially fulfilled, they marked the beginning of Latin America’s long journey toward freedom and self-determination.
