The Iranian Revolution of 1979 was one of the most dramatic and unexpected upheavals of the twentieth century. For decades before it, Iran had been ruled by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose monarchy was closely tied to Western powers, especially the United States and Britain. The Shah’s government presented itself as modern and progressive, introducing rapid industrialization, land reforms, and education programs in what was called the White Revolution. Yet beneath the surface, deep discontent was growing. Many ordinary Iranians felt that the Shah’s modernization favored the elite and foreign interests while neglecting the needs of workers, peasants, and the poor. Traditional religious leaders believed that Islamic values were being undermined by Westernization, while intellectuals and students criticized the regime for corruption and authoritarian rule.

The Shah’s government relied heavily on the secret police, known as SAVAK, to suppress dissent. Political parties were restricted, opposition figures were imprisoned or exiled, and freedom of expression was tightly controlled. Despite the glittering image of Tehran as a modern capital, inequality was stark, and resentment simmered among both the devoutly religious and the secular middle classes. This tension created a wide and unlikely coalition of groups—clerics, merchants, students, leftists, and ordinary citizens—who shared only one common demand: the end of the Shah’s rule.

The figure who came to embody this opposition was Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a senior Shi’a cleric who had been exiled in the 1960s for speaking out against the Shah’s reforms and his close ties to the West. From abroad, first in Iraq and later in France, Khomeini sent recorded speeches and writings into Iran, where they were widely circulated and became a powerful force of inspiration. He condemned the Shah as a puppet of foreign powers, accused him of betraying Islamic values, and called for a system of government led by Islamic jurists.

By the late 1970s, economic problems, rising inflation, and increasing repression fueled unrest. In 1978, protests erupted in different cities, often beginning as religious gatherings and then spreading into broader demonstrations. Each time the government used violence to suppress them, the movement grew larger. Strikes by oil workers and other industries paralyzed the economy, and the streets filled with millions of demonstrators demanding change. What began as scattered protests soon turned into a nationwide revolution.

The Shah attempted reforms and even declared martial law, but nothing could stop the wave of opposition. By January 1979, facing mass protests and loss of support even among the military, he left Iran for exile. In February, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran to a rapturous welcome from millions of people. Within days, the monarchy collapsed, and the Pahlavi dynasty, which had ruled Iran for more than half a century, was no more.

What followed was the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In a national referendum, the monarchy was abolished, and a new constitution was drafted that gave ultimate authority to the Supreme Leader, a religious figure. Ayatollah Khomeini became the first Supreme Leader, establishing the principle of Velayat-e Faqih, or rule of the Islamic jurist, as the foundation of the new state. Iran shifted away from Western alliances, expelled foreign influence, and restructured society under Islamic law.

The revolution had global consequences. It shocked Western powers, who lost a key ally in the Middle East, and it inspired Islamist movements in other parts of the world. Inside Iran, it brought profound change, with new restrictions on social life, especially for women, but also a sense of empowerment for those who had risen against dictatorship. Over time, the revolution’s promises of justice and freedom were debated and challenged, but its impact in reshaping Iran and the wider Middle East has been lasting.
