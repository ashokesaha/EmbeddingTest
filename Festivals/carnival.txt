Carnival in Brazil has its roots in Europe, tracing back to the Catholic tradition of celebrating before Lent, the forty-day period of fasting and penance. The Portuguese settlers brought this practice to Brazil in the 17th century, where it mingled with African music, rhythms, and dances introduced by enslaved people, as well as indigenous cultural expressions. Over time, it evolved into a uniquely Brazilian phenomenon, becoming an explosion of color, joy, and creativity. The Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is the most famous, with samba schools preparing all year to perform elaborate parades in the Sambadrome, each telling a story through music, costumes, and floats. On the streets, millions join in blocos—informal parades and parties—dancing, singing, and celebrating with infectious energy. Though deeply secular today, it still symbolizes the human desire to feast and rejoice before a time of restraint.
