Burning Man began in 1986 when a small group of friends burned a wooden effigy on a San Francisco beach as a symbol of self-expression and renewal. The act grew into a movement, and by the 1990s, it had moved to the Nevada desert, where an entire temporary city now arises every year. Built on principles like radical self-reliance, communal effort, and “leave no trace,” it attracts tens of thousands who create a living canvas of art installations, performances, and themed camps. The climax is the burning of the Man, a towering wooden structure, followed by the burning of a temple. It is more than a festival—it is a philosophy of creativity and community.
