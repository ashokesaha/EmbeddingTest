Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important celebration in the Chinese calendar, with origins more than 3,000 years old. According to legend, it began with the story of Nian, a mythical beast that would attack villages at the start of the year. To scare it away, people lit firecrackers, decorated their homes in red, and banged drums. The tradition stuck and evolved into the largest annual migration of people in the world, as families travel home for reunion dinners on New Yearâ€™s Eve. Homes are cleaned to sweep away bad luck, and red envelopes containing money are given to children as blessings. Lion and dragon dances fill the streets, and firecrackers light up the night. The festival lasts 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival, when thousands of lanterns float into the sky, symbolizing hope and renewal.
