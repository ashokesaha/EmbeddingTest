Glastonbury Festival in England began in 1970, just one day after Jimi Hendrix’s death, when farmer Michael Eavis organized a small concert. Inspired by the counterculture of the era, it grew into one of the world’s greatest music and performing arts festivals. It now spans multiple stages over several days, featuring some of the biggest names in music across genres, as well as theater, comedy, and art. More than just entertainment, it embodies activism and community spirit, raising awareness for causes while celebrating music’s power to bring people together.
