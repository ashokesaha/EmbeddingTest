Mardi Gras in New Orleans reflects the city’s French Catholic heritage. The name means “Fat Tuesday,” a final day of feasting before Ash Wednesday and the solemn season of Lent. In the 18th century, French colonists brought carnival traditions to Louisiana, where they mixed with African, Caribbean, and Spanish influences, producing something entirely new. Today, Mardi Gras is most famous for its parades with elaborate floats designed by “krewes”—social organizations that prepare all year. Masked revelers throw beads, trinkets, and coins to the crowds, while jazz bands fill the streets with music. King Cake, a colorful pastry with a hidden figurine inside, is shared among families and friends. It is a time of indulgence, spectacle, and liberation, showing the joyous spirit of New Orleans itself.
