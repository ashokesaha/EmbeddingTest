Gion Matsuri in Kyoto is Japan’s most famous festival, dating back to 869 CE, when the emperor ordered prayers and rituals to ward off a deadly plague. It has since grown into a grand month-long celebration in July, centered around magnificent parades of yamaboko floats. These floats, some towering over 25 meters and weighing tons, are constructed without nails, using intricate wooden joinery. Each is decorated with rich tapestries and ornaments, some centuries old. The festival is both religious and cultural, as the floats are considered to be temporary abodes for the gods. Kyoto’s streets fill with food stalls, people dressed in yukata, and processions that honor both Shinto deities and centuries of tradition. It is a blend of devotion, artistry, and summer festivity.
