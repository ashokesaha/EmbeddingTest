The Harbin Ice and Snow Festival in China is one of the most spectacular winter events in the world. Originating in 1963 with local ice lantern competitions, it became an official festival in 1985. Held in the city of Harbin, which endures subarctic temperatures, it showcases breathtaking structures made entirely of ice and snow, some as tall as buildings. At night, these sculptures glow with colorful lights, creating a magical frozen city. Visitors can wander through castles, slides, and sculptures, or watch ice sports and performances. It is both a tourist wonder and a proud display of human creativity against natureâ€™s extremes.
