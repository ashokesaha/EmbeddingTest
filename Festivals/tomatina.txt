La Tomatina in Bu√±ol, Spain, is perhaps the most playful of festivals. It began in 1945 when a group of young men got into a food fight during a local parade, using tomatoes from a nearby stall. Though banned at times, it returned by popular demand, and over the years it became an organized event. Today, on the last Wednesday of August, thousands gather to hurl overripe tomatoes at one another in good-natured chaos. The streets turn into a red river, and after an hour the festival ends with water hoses washing everything clean. It is pure fun, with no deeper meaning except joy and community spirit.
