The Day of the Dead in Mexico, or Día de los Muertos, is one of the most meaningful festivals in Latin America. Its origins go back thousands of years to Aztec and other indigenous rituals that honored death as a natural part of life. When the Spanish colonizers arrived, these traditions blended with Catholic practices around All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day. What emerged was a unique fusion: a festival where the dead are remembered joyfully rather than mourned. Families build ofrendas, or altars, decorated with marigolds, candles, food, drinks, and photographs to welcome the spirits of loved ones back to the world of the living. Skulls, once carved from sugar and now appearing as masks and decorations, symbolize both death and rebirth. In towns like Oaxaca and Mexico City, the streets fill with parades, music, and face paintings of skeletons, making it a festival of both family devotion and community celebration.
