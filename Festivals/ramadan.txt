Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr are central to Islam. Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is believed to be when the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset each day, abstaining from food, drink, and other indulgences, focusing instead on prayer, charity, and self-discipline. The fast is broken each evening with iftar, a communal meal often starting with dates and water. The end of Ramadan is marked by Eid al-Fitr, the “Festival of Breaking the Fast.” On this day, Muslims gather for morning prayers, wear new clothes, exchange gifts, and share festive meals. It is a day of joy and gratitude, emphasizing generosity and family togetherness.
