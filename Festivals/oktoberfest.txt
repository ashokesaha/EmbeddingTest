Oktoberfest in Munich began in 1810 to honor the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig (later King Ludwig I) and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen. A horse race and public celebration were organized on a field that was later named Theresienwiese (“Therese’s meadow”). The event was so well received that it became an annual tradition, evolving into the modern beer festival. It was gradually extended in duration, and beer tents became the heart of the celebration. Today, millions from around the world come to Munich each autumn to enjoy Bavarian culture at its most authentic—music, folk dancing, parades, hearty foods like roast chicken and sausages, and of course, rivers of beer served in giant steins by servers in traditional dress. Though commercialized, it is still a deeply cultural event, uniting locals and visitors in a spirit of gemütlichkeit—a German word meaning warmth, friendliness, and good cheer.
