Christmas, celebrated on December 25, commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. Though rooted in Christian theology, it has absorbed older winter solstice traditions, such as decorating with evergreen trees and lights. The story of the Nativity is central, with churches holding midnight masses and plays re-enacting the birth in Bethlehem. Over centuries, traditions like gift-giving and Santa Claus—based on Saint Nicholas, a bishop known for his generosity—have made it a global cultural holiday. Today, Christmas is celebrated with decorated trees, lights, feasts, carols, and gatherings of family and friends, symbolizing love, hope, and goodwill.
