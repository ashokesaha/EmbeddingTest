Songkran in Thailand, the Thai New Year celebrated in April, is rooted in the Buddhist and Hindu solar calendar. The word “Songkran” means “movement” or “change,” reflecting the sun’s passage into Aries. Traditionally, it was a time for cleaning homes, making merit at temples, and paying respect to elders by gently pouring scented water over their hands, symbolizing purification and blessings. Over time, this ritual expanded into large-scale public water fights, now a beloved and playful part of the festival. For several days, streets in cities like Chiang Mai and Bangkok become battlegrounds of joy, with people armed with buckets and water guns. Yet beneath the fun, families still visit temples, offer food to monks, and engage in acts of renewal, making it a celebration of both spirit and community.
