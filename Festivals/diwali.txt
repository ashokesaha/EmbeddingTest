Diwali in India is one of the most significant Hindu festivals, with stories tied to different deities depending on the region. The most widespread tale is from the Ramayana, where Lord Rama returns to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, and people light lamps to welcome him home. In other traditions, it honors Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, or commemorates the return of the Pandavas in the Mahabharata. Celebrated over five days, Diwali involves decorating homes with oil lamps and rangoli, offering prayers, bursting fireworks, exchanging sweets, and gathering with family. It symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The glow of lamps and joy of togetherness make it one of the most beautiful festivals in the world.
