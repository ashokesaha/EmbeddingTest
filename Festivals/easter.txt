Easter is the most sacred Christian festival, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus three days after his crucifixion. It represents renewal and victory over death, forming the foundation of Christian faith. The festival is preceded by Lent, a period of fasting and penance, and Holy Week, which recalls the Last Supper, the crucifixion, and the burial of Christ. On Easter Sunday, churches are filled with flowers and joyful hymns. Cultural customs such as Easter eggs and rabbits symbolize fertility and new life, linking the sacred with seasonal cycles of spring.
