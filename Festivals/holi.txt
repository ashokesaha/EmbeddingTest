Holi, also from India, is the festival of colors, celebrated at the end of winter to welcome spring. It has roots in Hindu mythology, particularly the legend of Prahlada, a devotee of Vishnu who was saved from the fire that consumed the demoness Holika. This story symbolizes the triumph of devotion and righteousness over evil. Holi begins with Holika Dahan, a bonfire representing the burning away of negativity. The next day, known as Rangwali Holi, is a riot of color, where people throw powders, splash water, sing, and dance in the streets. Barriers of caste, age, and status dissolve as everyone becomes covered in hues of joy. It is a celebration of renewal, love, and unity.
