Coachella, held in the California desert, is a more modern creation, beginning in 1999. It quickly became a cultural phenomenon, blending music, art, and fashion. Featuring global headliners and avant-garde art installations, it attracts celebrities, influencers, and music fans alike. The festival is as much about being seen—famous for its bohemian-chic fashion trends—as it is about the music. Yet it remains one of the premier platforms for live performances in the world.
