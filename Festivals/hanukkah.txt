Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights, recalls the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE, when the Second Temple in Jerusalem was rededicated. According to tradition, a small jar of oil meant to last one day miraculously burned for eight. To remember this, Jewish families light the menorah for eight nights, adding one candle each evening. Special prayers are said, and foods fried in oil, like latkes and doughnuts, are enjoyed. Children play with dreidels, and gifts are exchanged. It is a festival of resilience, hope, and faith, celebrated each winter.
